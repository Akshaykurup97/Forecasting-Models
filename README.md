# Forecasting-Models
Utilized Time-GAN and LSTM models to forecast electricity prices, achieving significant 6% reduction in mean errors compared to LEAR and DNN models.Trained neural network 
models on three distinct real-world datasets to capture varied market conditions and executed a Python-implemented RNN using an Adam optimizer to confirm precise 
electricity price forecasts.
